I spent almost a whole weekend designing and building this platform for my next project "c.elegans" and maybe other future projects. I named it "NXTCamel" because it looks a bit like a camel with four long legs, and it can carry a lot!

The building instructions can be downloaded [here](https://code.google.com/p/evolvingnxt/downloads/detail?name=nxtcamel_building_instruction.tar.gz&amp;can=2&amp;q=). Some features of NXTCamel are:

- All sensors are mounted and all motors are used (Lego Mindstorms NXT 1.0).
- It is like a car: two back wheels for driving and two front wheels for controlling the direction.
- All signal lines can be tightly attached to the body so they won't get stuck easily while moving around.
- The ultrasonic sensor can rotate 360 degrees, controlled by one motor, to measure distances from any angle.
- The body is flat, spacious, and stable. For example, I could easily mount a webcam or smartphone on it for more sophisticated projects.
- It consists of 187 pieces in total.
