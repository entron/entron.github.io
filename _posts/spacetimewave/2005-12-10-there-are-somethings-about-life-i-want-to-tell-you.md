title: There are somethings about life I want to tell you
---
摘自一个flash:
 
Be strong enough to face the world each day.  
Be weak enough to know you cannot do everything alone.  
Be generous to those who need your help.  
Be frugal with what you need yourself.  
Be wise enough to know that you do not know everything.  
Be foolish enough to believe in miracles.  
Be willing to share your joys.  
Be willing to share the sorrows of others.  
Be a leader when you see a path of others have missed.  
Be a follower when you are shrouded in the midst of uncertainly.  
Be the first to congratulate an opponet who succeeds.  
Be the last to criticize a colleaque who fails.  
Be sure where your next step will fall,so that you will not stumble.  
Be sure of your final destination,in case you are going to the wrong way.
Above all,be yourself.
