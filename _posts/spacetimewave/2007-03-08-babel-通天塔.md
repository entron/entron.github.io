"the Tower of Babel:  
     a tower in a story in the Old Testament of the Bible. According to the story, everyone originally spoke the same language, but when the people of Babel tried to build a tower that would reach to Heaven, God prevented them by making them all speak different languages. The people could not understand each other, and were unable to finish building the tower. People sometimes use the word "babel" to talk about a situation in which many people are talking at the same time and it is impossible to understand anyone."
     这部影片讲述了相距万里的几个角落里发生的几个故事，随着影片的继续这些故事和故事中的人都无比巧合有无比自然合理的联系起来。这一点和去年的奥斯卡获奖影片Crash一样，除了联系范围不是美国的一个城市而是整个世界。这部影片给我印象很深的一点是风土人情描述的很到位，充分表现出了不同文化的差异。从很多细节处理上也看得出影片制作的用心。这部片子3\.5星级推荐。
