title: 南非之旅照片之“我的旅程|Photos in SA “My Trip”
---
在[前三个博文](http://spacetimewave.net/tag/%E5%8D%97%E9%9D%9E)里，我是按照主题整理的照片。现在我打算按照我自己的旅行经历整理一些照片贴上来。



In [the previous 3 blog entries](http://spacetimewave.net/tag/%E5%8D%97%E9%9D%9E) I organized the photos with certain topics, but in this one I will choose a few photos based on my own experience of this trip.



第一张照片是在去程的飞机上拍的，我的松下lx3非常好的还原了壮观的云的色彩。



All right, the first one is a photo taken on the airplane. The colors of the cloud looks great thanks to my Lumix LX3\.

多数时间里我们待在南非最早的殖民城市Stellenbosch. 这是世界著名的葡萄酒产地之一。下面的三张照片分别是： 我们住的旅馆，旅馆附近的一个小山和山上拍的照片。



Most of the time we stayed in Stellenbosch, one of the oldest colonial town in SA. It's very famous for it's wine. The following 3 photos are the small lovely hotel we lived, a hill not far from it and a photo taken on this hill.

Stellenbosch有很多殖民特色的建筑比如下面这个：



There are lots of colonial style house in Stellenbosch like this:

虽然从官方政策上讲种族隔离在南非已经成为历史，但是你在这里仍然能感受到那段历史的遗迹。比如下面这个草坪一般白人是不会去的。



Officially there is no race separation any more in SA, but you can still feel this history easily. For example this lawn is practically only used by black people.

下面这张照片是我们在Stellenbosch大学STLAS中心的临时办公室，非常赞！



The offices we used in *STIAS* of Stellenbosch Uni is super as showed in this photo

这个小城市里有一些别具一格的餐馆。下面的两张照片是我们去过的一家。照片中的葡萄酒叫“第一夫人”，闻起来非常棒！



You can find some very cool restaurant in this town. Two photos taken in one of them. The wine in the first photo is called "First Lady". It smelled great!

一个周末我们开了700多公里去了Addo国家公园。去的路上还是有些危险的。在南非不建议游客晚上自己开车出去，而我们到达目的地的时候已经凌晨3点了。下面一张是我们旅馆大门上的牌子。



One weekend we drove more than 700km from Stellenbosch to Addo national park. The trip to there was a bit scary cause it's not recommend to drive late. When we arrived the hotel it's already 3 clock at night. Here is the plate on the gate of the hostel:

这个旅馆类似于我们国内的“农家院”形式，可是位置却前不着村后不着店。房间的装饰让我住在里面后感觉像回到了19世界维多利亚时代。另外我们的早餐实在是太精致了：



The hostel was within a local family's house and in the middle of nowhere. The decoration in the rooms and garden all made me felt that I was living in the 19's century. We also got surprisingly delicate breakfast there:

在回Stellenbosch的路上我们在一个几乎没人的海滩玩了一会。离这个海滩不远的地方有世界最著名的蹦极的地方，可惜我们没时间过去看。



On the way back to Stellenbosch we stopped by a beautiful see shore with almost no body. Not far from there is one of the most bridge jumping place in the world. It was a pity that we did go there.

在离开南非之前的一个周末，我们去了开普敦和好望角。下面这张照片是在去好望角的路上拍的。在南非，仍然有好多黑人住在大城市周围的贫民窟里。电影《第九区》就是在这样的一个贫民窟取景的。



In the weekend before we left SA, we went to Cape Point and Cape Town. The photos below was taken on the highway near Cape Town. There are still lots of black people living in such condition around big cities in SA. Actually the Alien's houses in the film "District 9" was shot in one of these district.

很流行的出租甲壳虫。



Losts of people rent this kind of car in Cape Town

这是美的让人震撼的非洲最南端的Cape Point (好望角附近)。印度洋和大西洋在这里交界。正在我写这篇博客的时候我才发现照片中可以看到一条白线，这大概就是交界线吧。



Wow, now this is the south most point of Africa the Cape Point. The Indian ocean and Atlantic ocean meets right here. Indeed I just noticed there is a white line in the see in this photo. Maybe it's the meeting line.

Cape Point周围的这块地方是世界上植被种类密度最大的地点。下面这张照片是这里的灯塔和这种花。



The land near Cape Point has the highest plants diversity in the world. This photo is the lighthouse and the flowers on the Cape Point:

好望角附近壮丽的日落。照片中是我的同事。

当然在这么奔波旅行后要好好犒劳犒劳自己喽：）



Of course we need to eat some see food after this trip:)
