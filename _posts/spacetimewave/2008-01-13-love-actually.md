title: Love actually
---
Two movies come to my mind recently. I think they are very good movies, but it seems  not many  people I know have seen even one of them.  So I'd like to share them with you here and hope you like them as I do.   
  
"Groundhog day"  
The groundhog day in this year is Feb 2nd, so I suggest you watch it on that day.  
  
"Love Actually"  
Wenyuan recommended it to me last year. This is a Christmas  film,  a little bit late now:),  but I think you still could see it during the spring festival. It's our "Christmas" anyway:)  "Love  actually is everywhere", says in the movie. If you are wondering  what's the meaning of life then  my first answer to this eternal question is: love. The meaning of my life is those I loved, those I love, those I will love, those who loved me, those who love me and those who will love me.
