title: The Physcial Review bibliography style file for Lyx
---
I use [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) (which by the way is the best software of it's kind I've used) to organize my research sources. The BibTex file exported from Zotero contends some extra fields which are not used in the Physical Review journals.  If you also use Lyx like me, you will find even though you choose the bibliography style as "apsrev" some extra information like the copy right declaration still show up in the compiled pdf file. One solution is to use the custom bst file attached instead of the default bibliography styles (like the "apsrev"). I created the bst file by simply deleting those unnecessary fields from a bst file I got from the SLAC website. If you know a better solution or if you find some problem please inform me.
