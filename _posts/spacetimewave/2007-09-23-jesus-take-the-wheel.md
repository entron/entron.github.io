---
"**Jesus, Take the Wheel**" is a [Grammy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy "Grammy") Award\-winning song written by [Brett James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_James "Brett James"), Hillary Lindsey and [Gordie Sampson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Sampson "Gordie Sampson"). It is the first single from [Carrie Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Underwood "Carrie Underwood")'s debut album, *[Some Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Hearts "Some Hearts")*. The song was nominated for [Song of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Year "Song of the Year"), and won [Best Female Country Vocal Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Female_Country_Vocal_Performance "Best Female Country Vocal Performance") as well as [Best Country Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Country_Song "Best Country Song") at the [Grammy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards "Grammy Awards").  
  
The song tells the story of a young mother who lives a hectic life. On her late\-night drive on a snow\-covered road in [Cincinnati, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio "Cincinnati, Ohio"),

the woman begins sorting out her emotions and bemoans not having enough

time to do the things that really matter. Then, her car hits a patch of

[black ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_ice "Black ice"),

causing the woman to lose control of her car. She panics, takes her

hands off the steering wheel and cries out to Jesus; shortly

thereafter, the car stops spinning and safely stops on the shoulder.

After taking stock of the situation (and seeing that her baby has

remained fast asleep in the rear seat), the woman decides to "give

Jesus the wheel" not only of her car but of her life also.
