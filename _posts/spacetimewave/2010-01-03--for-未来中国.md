《MtM》这是我最喜欢的专辑之一。不过经过我对歌词的仔细研究发现，它似乎是为将来的中国所作。一首首歌唱出了那时的一类类人的心声。下面是我的研究结果，仅供娱乐，如有雷同纯属情理之中。  
  
首先我最喜欢的[《No More Sorrow》](https://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNDA4NjkzNg==/v.swf), 每一次听到“Thieves and hypocrites”和“Your time has come to be erased”





























我都热血沸腾的恨不得拽起我心爱的M16出去走走，甩甩头。这首是仁民献给派\[对的。不信请看歌词：  
  
Are you lost  


In your lies  


Do you tell yourself I don't realize  
  


Your crusade's a disguise  


Replace freedom with fear  


You trade money for lives  
  


I'm aware of what you've done  
  
\[Chorus:]  


No more sorrow  


I've paid for your mistakes  


Your time is borrowed  


Your time has come to be replaced  
  


I see pain  


I see need  


I see liars and thieves  


Abuse power with greed  
  


I had hope  


I believed  


But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived  
  


You will pay for what you've done  
  
\[Chorus]  
  


Thieves and hypocrites  


Thieves and hypocrites  


Thieves and hypocrites  
  
\[Chorus x2]  
  


Your time has come to be replaced  


Your time has come to be erased




  
  
  
下面是绝望派对四部曲分别是献给征\[服的《leave out all the rest》（最下面的视频），献给派\[对创始人的《[What I've done](https://www.tudou.com/programs/view/K3dHEop3Fes/)》，唱给各级伶\[道的《[The little things give you away](https://www.tudou.com/programs/view/UMsnZZB7zoQ/)》和唱给自己的《[give up](https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzExODE0MTI=.html) 》。只转载第一部曲的歌词如下：  
  
I dreamed I was missing  


You were so scared  


But no one would listen  


Cause no one else cared  
  


After my dreaming  


I woke with this fear  


What am I leaving  


When I'm done here  
  


So if you're asking me  


I want you to know  
  
*\[Chorus]*  


When my time comes  


Forget the wrong that I've done  


Help me leave behind some  


Reasons to be missed  
  


And don't resent me  


And when you're feeling empty  


Keep me in your memory  
  


Leave out all the rest  


Leave out all the rest  
*\[End Chorus]*  
  


Don't be afraid  


I've taken my beating  


I've shared what I made  
  


I'm strong on the surface  


Not all the way through  


I've never been perfect  


But neither have you  
  


So if you're asking me  


I want you to know  
  
*\[Chorus]*  


When my time comes  


Forget the wrong that I've done  


Help me leave behind some  


Reasons to be missed  
  


Don't resent me  


And when you're feeling empty  


Keep me in your memory  
  


Leave out all the rest  


Leave out all the rest  
*\[End Chorus]*  
  


Forgetting  


All the hurt inside  


You've learned to hide so well  
  


Pretending  


Someone else can come and save me from myself  


I can't be who you are  
  
*\[Chorus]*  


When my time comes  


Forget the wrong that I've done  


Help me leave behind some  


Reasons to be missed  
  


Don't resent me  


And when you're feeling empty  


Keep me in your memory  
  


Leave out all the rest  


Leave out all the rest  
  


Forgetting  


All the hurt inside  


You've learned to hide so well  
  


Pretending  


Someone else can come and save me from myself  


I can't be who you are  


I can't be who you are




  
  
还有《Valentine's Day》和《In Pieces》是那些压错宝的人的歌。最后《[In Between](https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTM0MDA1MzQ0.html)》大概是“改过自新”的征［服献给仁民的, 歌词如下：

PS: 从来没有听过摇滚音乐会，听一场出色的rock concert算是我的新年愿望之一。
