title: The wifi in iOS 4.0 eats up my ipod touch battery in one day
---
After I upgraded my ipod touch to iOS 4\.0, the battery  now can only last at most two days even I don't use it at all. The reason for this drastic decrease of battery life is because wifi is always on in this version(which is turned off in iOS 3 when you don't use your ipod touch). The purpose of this "upgrade" is to enable the notification function of apps like skype, facebook when your ipod touch is in the standby mode. That's good thought, but why not just add a simple check to only enable wifi when there are actually some apps using it? Then users like me, who never use those notification functions, won't sacrifice one week's battery for nothing.
