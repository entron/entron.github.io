title: Inselphobia (恐岛症)
---
I am at Langeoog. It's a small island in the North Sea of Germany. During the first two days I didn't feel comfortable without any obvious reason, so I made up a theory to explain it. (just for fun, so don't take it seriously). I called my problem "Inselphobia". "Insel" means island in German, and "\-phobia" means "afraid of". (I didn't call it "islandphobia" because it doesn't sound cool.) Inselphobia is human beings nature attendance to be afraid of living on an unfamiliar island. This is protective as small islands might be flooded unexpectedly. Inselphobia is easily ignored: when you get familiar with the island environment you will soon be ok. Maybe I am the first one to discover and name this problem. This is why I wrote this blog in English.
