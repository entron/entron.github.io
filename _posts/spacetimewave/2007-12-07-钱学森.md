Early life and education
------------------------



Tsien Hsue\-shen was born in [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou "Hangzhou"), the capital of [Zhejiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang "Zhejiang") province, 180 km southwest of [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai "Shanghai"). He left Hangzhou at the age of three when his father obtained a post in the Ministry of Education in [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"). He graduated from the [National Chiao Tung University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University "National Chiao Tung University") (currently [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University "Shanghai Jiao Tong University")) in 1934 and in August of [1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935 "1935") Tsien Hsue\-shen left China on a [Boxer Rebellion Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boxer_Rebellion_Scholarship&action=edit "Boxer Rebellion Scholarship") to study at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology").



In [1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936 "1936") Tsien Hsue\-shen went to the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology") to commence graduate studies on the referral of [Theodore von Kármán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n "Theodore von Kármán"). Tsien obtained his doctorate in [1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939 "1939") and would remain at Caltech for 20 years, ultimately becoming the [Goddard Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goddard_Professor&action=edit "Goddard Professor") and establishing a reputation as one of the leading rocket scientists in the United States.



It was shortly after arriving at Caltech that Tsien was attracted to the rocketry ideas of [Frank Malina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Malina "Frank Malina") and a few other students of von Kármán, and their associates. Around Caltech the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname "Suicide Squad."



 

Career in the United States
---------------------------



In [1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943 "1943"), Tsien and two others in the Caltech rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory"); it was a proposal to the Army to develop missiles in response to Germany's V\-2 rocket. This led to the Private A, which flew in 1944, and later the Corporal, the WAC Corporal, etc.



During the Second World War, he participated in the "[Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project "Manhattan Project")".\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]



After [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") he served under Kármán as a consultant to the [United States Army Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Force "United States Army Air Force"), and was eventually given the "assimilated rank of colonel". Kármán and Tsien were sent by the Army to [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") to investigate the progress of wartime aerodynamics research. Tsien investigated research facilities and interviewed such German scientists as [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun "Wernher von Braun") and [Rudolph Hermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_Hermann&action=edit "Rudolph Hermann").[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsien_Hsue-shen#_note-1)



During this time, Colonel Tsien worked on a designing an intercontinental space plane \[Tsien Space Plane 1949]. His work would inspire the [X\-20 Dyna\-Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-20_Dyna-Soar "X-20 Dyna-Soar") which would later be the inspiration for the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle").



In [1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945 "1945") Tsien Hsue\-shen married Jiang Ying (蒋英), a famed opera singer and the daughter of [Jiang Baili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Baili "Jiang Baili") (蒋百里) \- one of [Chinese nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") leader [Chiang Kai\-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek "Chiang Kai-shek")'s leading military strategists, and his Japanese wife.



Soon after Tsien applied for U.S. citizenship in [1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950 "1950"), allegations were made that he was a communist and his security clearance was revoked. The [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") located a [1938](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938 "1938") [US Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Communist_Party "US Communist Party") document with his name on it. Tsien found himself unable to pursue his career and within two weeks announced plans to return to [mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China "Mainland China"). After his announcement the U.S. government wavered between deporting him and refusing to allow his departure due to his knowledge. Tsien became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and PRC. During this time he lived under virtual house arrest. Tsien found himself in conflict with the U.S. [Immigration and Naturalization Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service "Immigration and Naturalization Service"), including an arrest for carrying secret documents which ultimately turned out to be simple logarithmic tables. During his incarceration Tsien received support from his colleagues at Caltech including Caltech President [Lee DuBridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_DuBridge "Lee DuBridge"), who flew to Washington to argue Tsien's case. Caltech appointed attorney [Grant Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Cooper_(attorney) "Grant Cooper (attorney)") to defend Tsien. Later, Cooper would say, "That the government permitted this genius, this scientific genius, to be sent to Communist China to pick his brains is one of the tragedies of this century."[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsien_Hsue-shen#_note-2)



 

Return to China
---------------



In [1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955 "1955") Tsien was released and deported from the United States together with his wife and their two American\-born children as a part of post\-Korean war negotiations to free American prisoners of war held by China. He went to work as head of the Chinese missile program immediately upon his arrival in China. Tsien deliberately left his research papers behind when he left the United States. Tsien joined the [Communist Party of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China "Communist Party of China") in [1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958 "1958").



Tsien established the *Institute of Mechanics* and began to retrain Chinese engineers in the techniques he had learned in the United States and retool the infrastructure of the Chinese program. Within a year Tsien submitted a proposal to the PRC government to establish a ballistic missile program. This proposal was accepted and Tsien was named the first director of the program in late [1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956 "1956"). By 1958 Tsien had finalized the plans of the [Dongfeng missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongfeng_missile "Dongfeng missile") which was first successfully launched in [1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964 "1964") just prior to China's first successful nuclear weapons test. Tsien's program was also responsible for the development of the widespread [Silkworm missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkworm_missile "Silkworm missile"). Tsien also contributed a lot to China's Higher Education. He was the first Chairman of the Department of Mechanics of [University of Science \& Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_%26_Technology_of_China "University of Science & Technology of China") (USTC), a new type of university established by the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences "Chinese Academy of Sciences") (CAS) after the founding of the New China and aimed at fostering high\-level personnel of science and technology absolutely necessary for the development of the national economy, national defense construction, and education in science and technology.



In [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979 "1979") Tsien was awarded Caltech's *Distinguished Alumni Award*. In the early [1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s "1990s") the filing cabinets containing Tsien's research work were offered to him by Caltech. At first Tsien refused but was finally convinced by his former colleagues to accept the work. Most of these works became the foundation for the Tsien Library at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi'an_Jiaotong_University "Xi'an Jiaotong University") while the rest went to the Institute of Mechanics. Tsien eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend Frank Marble brought it to his home in a widely\-covered ceremony.



Tsien retired in 1991 and has maintained a low public profile in Beijing, China.



The PRC government launched its manned space program in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992 "1992") and used Tsien's research as the basis for the [Long March rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_rocket "Long March rocket") which successfully launched the [Shenzhou V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_V "Shenzhou V") mission in October of [2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003 "2003"). The elderly Tsien was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed.



[Science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") author [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke"), in his novel *[2010: Odyssey Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_Odyssey_Two "2010: Odyssey Two"),* named a Chinese spaceship after him.



 

Late life
---------



In his late years, since the [1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s "1980s"), Tsien devoted himself to [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") research, and advocated scientific investigation of traditional Chinese medicine, [Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong "Qigong") and "special human body functions".
