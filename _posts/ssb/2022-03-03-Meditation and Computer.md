I started learning meditation recently.

One concept I learned is “pop-out”. You focus on something simple such as your breathing. After a short moment your mind is likely to drift. The “pop-out” happens when you notice your ideas and thoughts and realise that you have been distracted. Then you gently bring back your attention to your breath again. This will happen again and again during the mediation, and you just practice the “pop-out” technique again and again.

After some days of practice I suddenly realised how “pop-out” helps you.

Your brain is like a computer and your ideas and thoughts are like processes. Sometimes one thought is so intense that it consumes almost 100% of the CPU and RAM of your brain, and you lose your control. You are lost in your thoughts and become anxious/angry/exhausted etc.

“pop-out” is the way to take the control back. It lets you realise what you truly are: you are not processes, you are the operating system.
