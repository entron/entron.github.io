The two terms “market economy” and “planned economy” can’t be more misleading. As the opposite of planned economy, the market economy sounds like the type of economy without planning, thus messy and less efficient. Actually this is the opposite of the truth. In a planned economy a small group of government employees make the plan and everybody else just follows. In a market economy every company/person makes plan, which means there are a million times more brains collecting and processing information simultaneously. If the intelligence of a planned economy is like a fancy desktop then intelligence of the market economy is like a huge cluster of servers. This is the reason why the market economy beats the planned economy. Saidly sometimes a better name beats a better theory or even the truth. Maybe the market economy does need some marketing.
