Innovation means being different. It requires courage to be the minority. Why does one need courage to be a minority? That is because human nature has the tendency to sacrifice the minority for the majority. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the more a society can tolerate, respect and protect minorities the more innovative a society is.

However, the paradox is, once a consensus is achieved, and the majority thinks a minority should be respected and protected, the minority is no longer the “real” minority. Opportunists may come and overdraft society’s kindness. People who are questioning become the new minority.

Change never stops, tolerance is always precious, and balance is an eternal pursuit.
