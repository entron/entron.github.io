* Main targeted audience are people who haven't used SSB and #new-people.
* It supports $\LaTeX$ using MathJax. You can use `$` for inline math and `$$` for displayed formulas. More instructions [here](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).
* It only shows feeds who explicitly set `publicWebHosting = True` . Currently there are 354 valid feeds, however they generated about $\frac{1}{4}$ of all contents on SSB. 
* As there are not many feeds it only updates once per day between 6 am to 7 am UTC time to reduce cost and $\ce{CO2}$ footprint.



I build this in my spare time. It's fun to build on top of SSB. To me it is more like a read-only static APP on SSB. The contents I intended to show while building the site are non-personal and of public interest content such as tech, science, history and art. 

Thanks [@cel-desktop](@lOUVT+Phkvai9a/cCS/RKo+S9hnPAQdVixms/7ldpPA=.ed25519) for answering many questions about SSB. Also thank [@cel-desktop](@lOUVT+Phkvai9a/cCS/RKo+S9hnPAQdVixms/7ldpPA=.ed25519) , 
[@Daan](@MRiJ+CvDnD9ZjqunY1oy6tsk0IdbMDC4Q3tTC8riS3s=.ed25519) and others in the community to provide valuable feedback to the website. I used [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate this site. Hugo is a very powerful product and has a very helpful community. Hope more people will learn about SSB and benefit from it.

PS (2023-02-09):

The indexed pages of [setinhash.com](http://setinhash.com) by google dropped from ten thousands to only 500, and monthly visits dropped from 20 to almost 0 during the past 6 months. As the purpose of this website is to attract new users I have to say I am a bit disappointed. I am thinking to take down the website and open the source code instead.

PS (2023-02-13):

I have uploaded all the code I used for my website, setinhash.com, to GitHub at the following link: 

https://github.com/entron/setinhash

The website will be shutting down in a few weeks, but I hope that the code may still be of use to others. 

I would like to extend my gratitude to @cel and many friends here for their invaluable help and advice during the development of the website.
