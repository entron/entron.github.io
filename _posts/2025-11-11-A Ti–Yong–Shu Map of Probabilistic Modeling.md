This article is mainly generated by ChatGPT, I have tried many prompts and the results is still not perfrect. However I found it already quite useful to give me a mind map of this field.

The Bayesian worldview has become so influential across many areas of modern science that it’s almost impossible to ignore, whether one likes it or not. It often feels as if, unless you speak this language, people won’t take you seriously — to the point that it sometimes seems like a religion dressed up as science, or a science that resembles a religion. I believe we should treat it as one of many useful tools, rather than let it confine our way of thinking. A thoughtful reflection on this is [*Holes in Bayesian Statistics*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06467).

Anyway, let's get back to the main topic.

The modern landscape of probabilistic modeling seems both rich and fragmented. From Bayes’ theorem to GANs, from variational inference to diffusion models, we find a vast collection of techniques—each powerful, yet sometimes disconnected. But is there a deeper unity?

To reveal this unity, we can borrow a classical conceptual framework from Chinese philosophy: **体 (Ti), 用 (Yong), and 术 (Shu)**—**Essence, Function, and Method**, which captures three complementary layers:

- Ti (体, Essence): the worldview, the first principles.
- Yong (用, Function): distinguishes *why* we model (infer, represent, generate, decide, explain).
- Shu (术, Algorithm): distinguishes *how* we compute (maximize, sample, approximate, compete, propagate).


Each concrete model (ICA, VAE, GMM, etc.) is thus a point in this three-dimensional design space. 



## **I. 体 (Ti): Foundational Principles**

| Principle                                | Essence                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Uncertainty as intrinsic to knowledge | Model distributions, not fixed values.               |
| 2. Latent generative process             | Observed data arise from hidden variables.           |
| 3. Learning = inference                  | To learn means to infer hidden causes or parameters. |
| 4. Rational belief updating              | Bayes’ rule provides a consistent mechanism.         |
| 5. Structure and parsimony               | Simpler probabilistic structures generalize better.  |



## **II. 用 (Yong): Core Purposes and Functions**

| **Energy minimization / message passing** | Solve inference in structured graphs.                     | Belief propagation, mean-field.                            |

## **IV. 合 (He): Integrative Table — Mapping Ti → Yong → Shu**

This is the **fourth integrative layer** — a *cross-mapping table* that shows for each major method:

* what it is fundamentally *for* (Yong: purpose),
* what *principle* or worldview it inherits (Ti connection), and
* what *technique* or inference mechanism (Shu) it relies on.


> Each method embodies one or more **Yong (functions)** and realizes it via certain **Shu (techniques)**, under the common **Ti (probabilistic worldview)**.
